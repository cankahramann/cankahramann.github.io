## About

Hello! My name is Can. I discovered my passion for coding in Graduate School of Boğaziçi University when I took my first computer science class. After realizing that I want to have a career in software development, I dropped out of grad school (and the neuroscience lab that I was affiliated with) and started working on web development on my own. 

To improve my skills, I've used free resources such as Odin Project and FreeCodeCamp. Here are some of the things I've made so far: https://cankahramann.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors/

When I learn new concepts, I try to put them into practice by working on small projects like these.


The main reason I want to be accepted to Tech Expert Academy is to accelerate my learning and land a job as a Full Stack Web Developer. I like challenging my learning skills in fast-paced environments! Since I solely work on web development right now, I can dedicate all my time to Tech Expert Academy.
